The Weather Android app is a straightforward weather display application developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. Its primary goal is to demonstrate fundamental Android concepts such as using parallel arrays, looping for calculations, activity navigation, user input handling, and displaying weather data.

Screens and Features are : 

Welcome Screen (WelcomeActivity):

Shows app name, developer info, logo, and a Start button.
Serves as the entry point to navigate to the main weather display.
Main Screen (MainActivity):

Displays a list of days, their maximum temperatures, and weather conditions.
Calculates and shows the average maximum temperature.
Includes buttons to return to the Welcome Screen or navigate to the Edit Screen.
Edit Screen (EditScreen):

Lets users edit temperatures and weather conditions for each day via dynamically generated EditText fields.
Has a Save button that updates in-memory data and returns to the Main Screen.
Technical Details:

Uses three parallel arrays: days[], maxTemps[], and weatherConditions[].
Employs loops to display data and compute averages.
Implements activity navigation with explicit intents.
Utilizes basic UI components like TextView, Button, EditText, and LinearLayout
